# Media-Database-Efficiency-Enhancements

# Overview
This project addresses inefficiencies in the media database team's workflow by automating quality check (QC) report distribution and consolidating Excel files. The goal is to improve productivity and save time for both individual contributors and managers.

# Problem Statement
The current process involves employees accessing a shared QC file to check their individual reports. On average, 85% of employees access this file, even though only 15% need to make updates. Each employee spends around 10 minutes checking the file, leading to approximately 13 hours of wasted time dailyâ€”equivalent to the productivity of 2 additional employees.

# Solution
# 1. Automated QA Reports
To address the inefficiency of checking the shared QC file:

# Power Automate: 
Implemented Power Automate to send individual QA reports directly to employees' email inboxes.
# Hyperlinks: 
Included hyperlinks to specific contacts/outlets within the QA report for quicker issue resolution.
Benefits:
# Time Savings: 
Reduces the time spent accessing the QC file by 10 minutes per employee per day.
# Increased Efficiency: 
Frees up approximately 13 hours of work time daily.

# 2. Media Move Excel File Automation
Automated the Media Move shared Excel file to streamline processes and improve efficiency. Implementation is in progress.

# 3. Consolidation of Excel Files
Proposed consolidating various team Excel reports to:

Reduce Managerial Effort: Save time spent by managers on compiling and analyzing data.
Improve Focus: Allow managers to concentrate on higher-priority tasks.
Benefits
Enhanced Productivity: The automation and consolidation efforts effectively add the equivalent productivity of 2 additional employees.
Increased Efficiency: Significant reduction in time wasted on administrative tasks.
Next Steps
Implement Automation: Finalize and monitor the rollout of automated QA reports.
Evaluate and Adjust: Assess the impact of these changes and make necessary adjustments.
Report Consolidation: Begin consolidating Excel reports and measure time savings.
